## Introduction

This test aims at demonstrating your capacity to develop a service from scratch in Go, using both synchronous and asynchronous communication. We expect from your code to be:
* Simple and concise
* Smart
* Properly documented

Also, your technical choices, if any, should be described. To go through this exercise, we expect you to be familiar with SQL, messaging patterns such as consumer queues and sequencing, and replication.

As a global advice, do not write complex code, keep things as simple as possible and try to stick to the basics.

## Assignment

As your system is getting bigger and bigger, you now need to integrate [audit logs](https://www.dnsstuff.com/what-is-audit-log) to keep track of who is accessing/mutating which resource at a given time. To do so, you'll build a placeholder API which should emit an event to a message broker which will then be consumed by an audit logs worker to be eventually stored into a database. Please find below an architecture diagram to illustrate the communication flows:

![Diagram](assets/diagram.png)

Note that we will not focus on tracking mutations themselves, such as storing previous and current state of mutated resources. Let's keep things simple.

## Walkthrough

### Useful commands

Multiple `docker-compose` files have already been written for you. To make things easier, there is no network definitions so you can call the services on localhost. You might or not want to use them. If you prefer to use a different message broker from NSQ or NATS, it's up to you. But we expect another `docker-compose` file to be added to your repository. Only PostgreSQL is a requirement.

* Start NATS + PostgreSQL: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.nats.yaml up -d`
* Start NSQ + PostgreSQL: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.nsq.yaml up -d`
* Start Jaeger: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.jaeger.yaml up -d`

### Structure your workspace

Start with setting up a proper structure for your workspace. We expect files to be organized in a coherent way and to be easy to locate. Also, both the placeholder API and the audit logs consumer should stand as 2 different go modules.

### Placeholder API

Write the placeholder api. You can give it any name you want and use any libraries or not. In the diagram, we assessed that the original call made by the client was a mutation intent on an accounts with id `id`. You can definitely change that, it's only an example. This API should consist of:
* A router
* A single route that matches a given pattern
* A producer to emit to the message broker

At this time, it means that you should already have in mind the data model of your audit logs to make sure that you can properly answer the following questions:
* Who ?
* What ?
* At which time ?

### Audit logs consumer

Write the code for the consumer. It should listen to a given topic/channel and store the audit logs to a database. Your consumer should be:
* Horizontally scalable
* Failure tolerant
* Self healing

We expect from you to come up with a data model for storing the audit logs and write SQL migrations accordingly. Migrations should either be run independantly from your service, or at it's startup time.

### Containerize your applications

Write the dockerfiles to containerize both your systems.

### Running the system

From the root directory run:
```
make deploy
```

This will run services using docker compose.

## Bonus points (2 max.)

* Integrate build/run steps inside of the `docker-compose.yaml` file, or a dedicated one.
* Integrate structured logging, using a third party library, with basic settings such as verbosity and format.
* Write integration tests for your repository layer.
* [Only if it was all too easy for you and you got plenty of time] Use the [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/) deployment to trace your code end-to-end.

## Requirements

* We expect you to fork this repository before starting working on it.
* Your code should be, at least partially, unit tested. We do not expect every single line of code to be but would like to evaluate your knowledge in testing.

Happy coding üçÄ
